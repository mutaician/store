# Store Rails Practice

This is a small project I am trying out to remember how rails work, it's been long since I used it.
Everything is from the [documentation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v8.0/getting_started.html#rails-console) to know the basics and work on my own project

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
